MC "[playMusic(Shera)] They worry too much just because this year I have the entrance exams, but... {a} Should I care about that? {c} I’ve been studying every year killing myself and I have left the girls aside, while everyone else was having fun with their couple, I killed myself studying."

Airi "[setExpression(Airi,body,angry,4)] If you really studied like you say, your grades wouldn't be so horrible..."

MC "[Buzz()]-guuhh"

Airi "[setExpression(Airi,body,annoyed,4)] And that all the girls reject you doesn’t mean that you have voluntarily left them aside, after all you are not popular at all."

MC "[Buzz()]----gaahhhhhhhh, Even if I am bad at flirting, I try hard, and there is also a girl I still have a chance with."

Airi "I don't know how Tachibana hasn't sent you to fly yet"

MC "And it's not that the others have rejected me because I don't stand out!!! {a} It's because I haven't had a chance to close my distance with them! {C} Yes, that's right. {A} It's because I've been letting each opportunity I've had to bond with a girl."

Airi "[setExpression(Airi,body,normal,4)] And the one to whom you were practically her slave for a week? {c} Weren't you with her all that time?"

MC "[Buzz()]Aaaaaah!!!"

narrator "I got ready as fast as I could, yelling so that my sister's words wouldn't continue to hurt me. [exit(Airi)]"

MC "*Yawn*[setBackground(Kitchen_MC_1,false,1)]"

mcFather "With that attitude you make me doubt my decision to educate you..."

narrator "I don't even make it to the table and they are already attacking me."

MC "Have they all conspired to be against my self-esteem today?"

mcMother "It's your dad's way of encouraging you to start your last school year off right."

narrator "How is it that treating me badly will encourage me?"

MC "It would be much more helpful to my desire to study, if they gave me more freedom."

mcMother "You freely walk around the city with your friends, and you always come home late, I don't know what more freedom you want."

MC "I would love to be allowed to have a girlfriend..."

mcMother "..."

mcFather "I won’t object if with that you stop making so much noise at night. [playMusic(MagicalSecun)]"

MC "..."

mcFather "..."

mcMother "..."

Airi "..."

narrator "I decided to retire with my morale destroyed. [exit(Airi)] {c}[setBackground(HouseStreet_0,false,1) playMusic(Relax)]I take a long breath trying to free myself from all the emotional wounds left by my family."

MC "Ahhh…"

narrator "It’s not that I haven't tried, for some reason whenever I try to get close to a girl it only ends up increasing our distance. {c} As if I was destined to remain alone and  virgin for life."

MC "Aaaaaah, worst of all, I have to go to college next year. {a} I won't have time to flirt with girls!"

narrator " I scream my only wish before finishing high school."

MC "Damn I want a girlfriend!!!"

narrator "As I was walking down the street I saw in the distance a thin girl with glasses, a figure that was already quite familiar to me. {c} [playMusic (Time)] I start running towards my childhood friend yelling her name."

MC "¡¡Tachibana!!"

narrator "Tachibana keeps walking looking at the ground."

MC " No answer, hah?"

narrator "As I get closer I can see that she has a remorseful expression on her face.{a} I'm going to annoy her a little, hopefully that will reduce her discouragement a bit. {c}[enter(Tachibana)] When I'm too close to her I decide to whisper her name in her ear"

MC "Hey,{w 1} Tachi-"

Tachibana "[setExpression(Tachibana,body,shocked,4)]Hiiii!"

narrator "[playSfx(punch)]I get to hear a loud thud before I feel a very sharp pain on my cheek."

Tachibana "[mainCharacterName] A-are you okay? [setExpression(Tachibana,body,sad,4)]"

MC "Yeah, yeah I'm fine, it was my fault for sneaking up on you."

narrator "The girl who is desperately apologizing for slapping me is Tachibana Hitomi, and as you can see she is very cute…{c}I would date her if it weren't for the fact that every time I have tried to get close to her romantically, I have been ignored."

MC "Whenever I seem to be making progress, she moves away from me..."

Tachibana "[setExpression(Tachibana,body,normal,4)]?"

MC "Nothing! Nothing! Forget everything you heard! [playMusic(Shera)]"

Tachibana "Sure you're okay?"

narrator "With an internal sigh, I beg the universe not to let me be left alone.{c} Haaa, everything went wrong for me today, hopefully because all my luck is accumulating for a fated match.{c}[setExpression(Tachibana,body,sad,4)] Tachibana seems to start worrying because I didn't answer her again "

MC "Damn cheering her up is being more difficult than I thought. {c} Haha, don't worry it just seems like I'm delirious a bit ..."

narrator "Tachibana makes a huge expression of surprise. [setExpression(Tachibana,body,o,6) playMusic(Time)]"

Tachibana "I- *snif*, I’m so-*snif* [setExpression(Tachibana,body,sad,6)]"

narrator "Little tears begin to form in Tachibana's eyes {c} Shit! It seems that I am the one who is making her suffer the most"

MC "C-Come on, I told you it was my fault, you don't have to worry, it was just a joke .."

Tachibana "You are really fine?"

MC "As if nothing had happened, besides if at any moment you feel that I am exceeding myself you can hit me as much as you want."

Tachibana "Are you seriously okay with me hitting you? [setExpression(Tachibana,body,smile1,6)]"

MC "If that makes you vent and feel more safe, then I'll hold up to a beating."

narrator "Tachibana begins to clench her fist. [setExpression(Tachibana,body,smile2,6)]"

MC "Oy, oy, it was just an expression, you don't have to knock me out now!"

Tachibana "[setExpression(Tachibana,body,laugh,6)] Hahaha, you don't have to offer yourself something if you're going to be a wimp later."

narrator "From now on I must be more careful with jokes."

MC "But I managed to cheer you up, didn't I?"

Tachibana "Yes.[setExpression(Tachibana,body,smile2,6)]"

narrator "[setExpression(Tachibana,body,laugh,6)]Tachibana laughs as her face flushes, and her hair begins to shine affirming my idea that she is very pretty, it even seems that a light begins to emanate from her-"

MC "Damn how can you be so cute! [setExpression(Tachibana,body,shocked,6)]{c}[playSfx(punch) setExpression(Tachibana,body,annoyed,6)]{c} You see?, you can be calm next to me."

narrator "I start to touch my cheek with the intention of making the pain go away."

MC "And you can even vent to me... ouch!"

narrator "As I try to hide the pain of being slapped a second time today, I keep joking with Tachibana."

Tachibana "Hehe, thank you [mainCharacterName]. [setExpression(Tachibana,body,smile2,6)]"

narrator "[playMusic(Time)] She seems to be better now. {a} But she's been having a lot of trouble at home lately...{c} Before I could think of another way to annoy her, Tachibana makes a gesture of having remembered something and started running back home."

Tachibana " It's true! I forgot my lunch. {a} You can go ahead without me... [setExpression(Tachibana,body,sad,6)]"

MC "What? Wait!"

narrator " Tachibana begins to disappear from my sight.[exit(Tachibana)]{a} I thought I was making some progress...{c} And there is also the possibility that she becomes depressed again... with what it takes to make her laugh...{c} Although if I cheer her on again, I will earn a lot of points with her.{a} But that's at the cost of her having a bad time first...{c} Ahhh, what should I do ?!"
