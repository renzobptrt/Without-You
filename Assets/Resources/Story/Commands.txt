Commands for Visual Novel.
Every click event is a separate line in the file. The events below show how to call actions to make the chapter work.
Each line may have multiple actions. Actions on the same line should be delimited by a space. Because of this, no value,
including filenames, should contain spaces.




#DIALOGUE COMMANDS
#Make a character speak
case "c": //wait for input and clear {c}
case "a": //wait for input and append {a}
case "w": //wait for set time and clear {w1} //Number is the time
case "wa"://wait for set time and append {wa1}//Number is the time

#REGULAR ACTION COMMANDS
actions are called as normal. But if you want to delay an action, precede it with the delay tag followed by the amount
of time you want the action to be delayed. such as <delay=15>action()  or  <delay+25>action()
#Change character expressions
  setFace(characterName,expressionName)                                         ex: setFace(Raelin,happy01)

#Special Transitions For Layers and Overlay
use special transitions instead of normal fading to fade out entire scene or just change images on a layer like the background or foreground.
  transBackground(imagename,transitionEffect)                                   ex: transBackground(forest,hurricane)

  *optional parameters (order does not matter)
    1. speedOfTransition                                                        ex: trans__________(forest,hurricane,5)
    2. smoothing                                                                ex: trans__________(forest,hurricane,true)

#Show or Hide the entire scene with a special transition to or from black.
